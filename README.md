### Features: 

#### 1) Code style: we used html, css, and javascript. We found great success using the Bulma styling library.
#### 2) There are 2 API calls, a local storage aspect, autofill in the search button, 

### How to use: enter the ticker symbol in the data field, and viola, you can learn important information about your holdings.
